            "text": "Nail boards are yogic tools that originated in India over 2,000 years ago, also known as 'bed of nails' or 'sadhu boards'. Our feet and palms have thousands of energy points and nerve endings linked to all internal organs and systems of the body.\n\nStanding on nail boards regulates the nervous system and trains the mind to respond to any stressors with resilient calm and focus, like an ice bath without the cold!\n\nBesides promoting stress resilience, nail boards also offer great physical benefits, such as relieving muscle tension, improving blood and lymph circulation, and releasing endorphins, which are natural 'feel-good' hormones for self-healing."
