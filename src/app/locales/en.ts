            text: "Nail boards are yogic tools that originated in India over 2,000 years ago, also known as 'bed of nails' or 'sadhu boards'. Our feet and palms have thousands of energy points and nerve endings linked to all internal organs and systems of the body.\n\nStanding on nail boards regulates the nervous system and trains the mind to respond to any stressors with resilient calm and focus, like an ice bath without the cold!\n\nBesides promoting stress resilience, nail boards also offer great physical benefits, such as relieving muscle tension, improving blood and lymph circulation, and releasing endorphins, which are natural 'feel-good' hormones for self-healing."

Due to its natural antimicrobial properties, it can help inhibit the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms .\n\nThis excellent conductor of electricity has great aesthetic qualities and requires low maintenance. Due to their corrosion resistance, copper nails require minimal care compared to other metals. They can last for an extended period without the need for replacement or frequent upkeep.",

This property is particularly useful when traveling. Sadhu boards with a step of 10 MM weigh only 288g, and thatâ€™s an impressive factor counting on the useful area covered by nails. \n\nThese nails are naturally resistant to corrosion, as aluminum forms a protective oxide layer when exposed to air. This corrosion resistance makes this king of nails suitable for outdoor usage.  Aluminum is an excellent conductor of electricity. This property makes aluminum nails suitable for practice on the earth.",

            title: "How to choose material",
            text: "The choice of material is first and just as important as the choice of nail pitch. Our team conducted a study in which our engineer stood on different types of sadhu boards for 182 days - for an hour and more. He noticed a difference in the perception. \n\nNails made from cooper are subjectively \"softer\" than all other types. The practice is soft and smooth, even if you stand for an hour or more. \n\nAluminum nails are the perfect choice for those who need dynamism. The weight of 288 g does not prevent you from taking them with you everywhere. Just imagine that you are left on nails on top of a mountain (in expeditions, the total weight of your luggage is important). This metal, like copper, is an ideal current conductor, which allows the use of sadhu boards with open nails for grounding in nature.",
